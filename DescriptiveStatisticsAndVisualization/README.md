# DescriptiveStatisticsAndVisualization
Matlab examples for computing descriptives statistics of a data set and
constructing histograms and boxplots for the data. Taken from "Probability
Models for Data Analysis."

DescriptiveStatisticsAndVisualization.mlx: MATLAB LiveScript that demonstrates
how to compute descriptive statistics of a univariate data set. These include
measures of central tendancy (mean, median, and mode), measures of variability
(variance, standard deviation, range, and interquartile range), measures of
asymmetry (skewness and Bowley's measure of skewness), and a measure of the
importance of outliers (kurtosis). This LiveScript also produces histograms and
a box and whisker plot of the same data set.

DescriptiveStatisticsAndVisualization.m: Matlab script that performs the same
functionality as DeescriptiveStatisticsAndVisualization.mlx
