# SimpleLinearRegression

Matlab examples for creating, visualizing, and assessing a simple linear
regression model from data.

**simpleSalaryRegression.mlx:** MATLAB LiveScript that demonstrates how to load
data from an external file into a table data structure, construct a linear
regression model from the data, and then visualize both the data (as a scatter
plot) and the model as a line plot.

**simpleSalaryRegression.m:** MATLAB script that performs the same functionality as
simpleSalaryRegression.mlx

**simpleSalaryRegressionCorrelationAnalysis.mlx:** MATLAB LiveScript that
demonstrates how to load data from an external file into a table data structure,
construct a linear regression model from the data, visualize both the data and
and the model, and assess the degree to which the data should be describable by
a linear model through normal correlation analysis.

**simpleSalaryRegressionCorrelationAnalysis.m:** MATLAB script that performs the same functionality as
simpleSalaryRegressionCorrelationAnalysis.mlx

**SalaryData.csv:** data set from https://www.kaggle.com/karthickveerakumar/salary-data-simple-linear-regression
