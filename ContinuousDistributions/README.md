# ContinuousDistributions
Matlab examples of computing probabilities of events with the normal, standard normal, chi-squared, and Student's T distributions. Examples are included that illustrate how these distributions can be used as sampling distributions for various statistics of random samples. Taken from "Probability Models for Data Analysis"

**ContinuousDistributionExamples.mlx:** MATLAB LiveScript that demonstrates how
to compute probabilities using normcdf chi2cdf, and tcdf. Particular emphasis
is given to examples that illustrate how normcdf and tcdf can be used as sampling
distributions for describing the behavior of sample means.

**ContinuousDistributionExamples.m:** MATLAB script that performs the same
functionality as ContinuousDistributionExamples.mlx.
