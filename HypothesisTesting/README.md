# HypothesisTesting
Matlab examples for performing hypothesis tests using the Fisher's significance
testing methodology. MATLAB LiveScripts and scripts include simple hypothesis
tests attached to elementary distributions as well as tests related to model
assessment. Taken from "Probability Models for Data Analysis."

**HT_DiscreteExamples.mlx:** MATLAB LiveScript that carries out examples of the
binomial, geometric, hypergeometric, and Poisson tests.

**HT_DiscreteExamples.m:** MATLAB script that accomplishes the same tasks as
HT_DiscreteExamples.mlx.

**HT_ContinuousExamples.mlx:** MATLAB LiveScript that carries out examples of
the Z and T tests.

**HT_DiscreteExamples.m:** MATLAB script that accomplishes the same tasks as
HT_ContinuousExamples.mlx.

**ModelAssessment.mlx:** MATLAB LiveScript that carries out examples of
Pearson's goodness of fit test and Normal Correlation Analysis.

**ModelAssessment.m:** MATLAB script that accomplishes the same tasks as
ModelAssessment.mlx.
