# DiscreteDistributions
Matlab examples of computing probabilities of events with the binomial, hypergeometric, geometric, and Poisson distribution (both pdf and cdf). Taken from "Probability Models for Data Analysis"

**DiscreteDistributionExamples.mlx:** MATLAB LiveScript that demonstrates how to
compute probabilities using binopdf and binocdf, hygepdef and hygecdf, geopdf
and geocdf, and poisspdf and poisscdf.

**DiscreteDistributionExamples.m:** MATLAB Script that performs the same
functionality as DiscreteDistributionExamples.mlx.
