# Probability
This is a repository of instructional examples and projects that are tied to my probability textbook, "Probability Models for Data Analysis." For now, all code examples are written in MATLAB (as livescripts), but a task on the to-do list is to make this repository more language agnostic. I'll eventually be porting the examples to python, R, and Julia.

Here is an overview of the directory structure within this repository.

## Core Lessons
- **Classical-Probability:** Develop skills using the classical interpretation of probability (and its associated counting utilities such as the multiplication rule, combinations, permuataions, and factorials) to assign probabilities to outcomes in a sample space.
- **Frequentist-Probability:** Develop skills using the frequentist interpretation of probability to assign probabilities to outcomes in a sample space.
- **DescriptiveStatisticsAndVisualization:** Learn to analyze data sets and understand their structure by computing a suite of descriptive statistics that quantify central tendency, variability, asymmetry, and importance of outliers. Visualize the relationship between these measures and the data itself by constructing visualizations of the data set that include histograms, box and whisker plots, and quantile-quantile plots.
- **DiscreteDistributions:** Gain an understanding of how the binomial, geometric, hypergeometric, and Poisson distribution describe specific kinds of measurements and practice computing probabilities with these distributions.
- **ContinuousDistributions:** Gain an understanding of how the normal, student's t, and $\chi^2$ distributions to model the behavior of sampling statistics and practice computing probabilities with these distributions.
- **ParameterEstimation:** Fit probability distributions to data sets they might model using the method of moments or maximum likelihood estimation. Validate the fit between the model and data.
- **HypothesisTesting:** Execute discrete (binomial, geometric, hypergeometric, and Poisson) hypothesis tests and continuous (z, t, $\chi^2$) hypothesis tests.

## Supplementary Lessons
- **SimpleLinearRegression:** Fit a linear model data that appears to exhibit a linear relationship between a dependent variable and a single independent variable.
- **SamplingFromDistributions:** Use random number generators to create synthetic data sets. Also, collect random samples from existing data sets.
- **Markov:** Define and calibrate a discrete time Markov model and use it to simulate natural processes.
- **MAP-BL:** Build upon your parameter estimation skills with Maximum *a posteriori* estimation and Bayesian Learning. 

## Projects
- **ProjectExamples:** This direcory includes a variety of examples of completed projects in which a simple, scientific method is designed and conducted and its results are analyzed. The methodology for these experiments is the scientific method + significance testing / hypothesis testing. Reports and code are included.
